Farbox Editor is a dedicated tool for writing.

Drag images or other attachments to insert.
Markdown and plain text are both supported here.

The folder shaped button from menu toggles FileManager, where you can manage sites/categories/posts.
You can also manage them in your local FarBox directory.

Editor is always simple, but there are also many features that are worth exploring, try `Ctrl+8` to find the first one. ：）

Enjoy!
